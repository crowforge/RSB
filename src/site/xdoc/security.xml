          <p>It is possible to run RSB in secure mode where only authorized users can use certain applications</p>
          <p>This is done by doing the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Activate security by uncommenting the blocks title "Uncomment to enable security" in <b>web.xml</b> and <b>security-beans.xml</b></li>
          <li>Configure a Spring Security authentication provider in <b>security-beans.xml</b> to retrieve users from LDAP, Database...</li>
          <li>Configure RSB to associate applications with authorized users and/or roles.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following demonstrate how to configure RSB</p>
